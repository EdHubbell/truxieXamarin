# truxieXamarin

This app was initially built based on Hanselman.forms, which is a demo app from Xamarin & James Montemagno.  
There are still some crumbs of that project left in this one.

## What is truxie?

Way back in heady days of 2012, when everyone (well, seemingly) had a food truck location app, truxie was my attempt.  The initial 
pitch and coding done at a Startup Weekend was enough to win the event (which ,when paired with $2, may be used to source coffee).
I perservered with the idea, taking 3 months off from my job to code an actual app and get things running.
It continues to be available in Google Play store and iOS App Store, as well as at truxie.com.  About 300 people a week use it in the Durham/Raleigh 
area to find food trucks near them.

truxie had plans for global scaling and domination (don't we all?).  Obviously, that hasn't worked out.  


## What is truxieXamarin?

The original truxie app/site was written in Sencha and wrapped up in PhoneGap/Cordova.  I was never happy with the performance or the 
overall development model of using html 5 and wrapping it up - There was always some 
exception case (sometimes even phone level debug stuff) that came along with cross platform mobile dev work.  It was frustrating enough 
that once the app was published, adding features was always an ordeal that I dreaded.

I found out about Xamarin and figured the best way to eval it was to move something else into it - So truxieXamarin was born.  

The XamarinEvolve 2014 conference was imminent when I open sourced this code - I figure the best way to use my time at Evolve 
would be if I could easily share something I'm working on.  And since I recently left my 15 year career at Cree to concentrate on 
more mobile projects written in Xamarin (via http://GSDware.com), I'm going to need to evolve fast.
